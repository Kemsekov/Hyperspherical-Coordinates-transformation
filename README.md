# Hyperspherical-Coordinates-transformation
We can represent any n-dimensonal vector as it's angle components multiplied by it's length.

This is how we define a spherical coordinate system in 3 dimensions, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system

This piece of code gives you generalized tool to do hyperspherical transformation for any n-dimensonal vector to hyperspherical
coordinates system and reverse.

Very useful tool
